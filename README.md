You're tired of always looking for videos on different sites
You want to discover other teams, other championships?

Minimum Viable Product
In the navbar you can see:
- A HomePage: the Homepage will explain to the visitors the concept and how it works with a short description.
- The "Highlights" page: In "All highlight" they will be able to watch all the videos. They will be able to sort out the videos by countries, by team, by championship, etc...
- A FAQ page
- A "suscription" or "login" page with registration forms.

Backlog
- The "Highlights" button: On the nav, the visitors will have two options "All highlights" or "Your highlights". 
In "All highlight" they will be able to watch all the videos.
In "Your highlights" they will be able to see the videos of the team they have chosen during the suscription. If not suscribed, this page will show them (maybe with a pop-up) that they have to suscribe.
- To add another API from a betting site.
